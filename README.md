This repository contains the codebase for the [Grainger Engineering Metro Map project](https://d7.cs.illinois.edu/projects/Grainger-Engineering-Metro-Map/). Namely:
- The metro map coordinate generation algorithm (generate-graph/nongeosubwaygenerator.py)
- The d3 engine to create a metro map style diagram from a graph representation (js/visualization.js)
